# Food logger/planner for learning React.
I want try out React, so I'm learning by building a simple meal logger
or planner. The point is to learn. I'll probably be doing many things
incorrectly, wrong, or non-react style. Feel free to send a PR or file a suggestion
(issue) with an example. Thanks!
